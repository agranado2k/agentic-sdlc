## Current state — 2026-08-27

<!--
Update this block IN PLACE. It is the only part of this file that is edited
rather than appended to: it answers "where is this project right now?" for an
agent (or a human) opening a fresh session, and a stale answer here poisons
every session that reads it. Entries below are append-only.

Keep it to facts an agent cannot cheaply derive: the phase, what is live, what
is in flight. Do not restate the README.
-->

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Phase** | The kit is shipping. Shared layer 0.7.0; the constitution, both gates, the guards, the skills, the adapters and the consumer workflow templates are all in place and under test. |
| **Repo** | `agentic-sdlc`, a template repository (`main`). Feature work happens in `worktree/<slug>` on a `<type>/<slug>` branch. |
| **Remote** | `git@github.com:agranado2k/agentic-sdlc.git` |
| **Deployed / live** | Nothing is deployed — the kit's delivery is "Use this template" plus `sh bootstrap.sh`. |
| **Spec status** | Wave-based; tickets are the unit of work and each one carries a capability tier. |
| **Self-hosting** | The kit now obeys its own constitution: root `AGENTS.md`, the two shims, this docs set, and a green `sh scripts/check.sh` at the repo root. See `docs/adr/0001-the-kit-self-hosts-its-own-constitution.md`. |
| **Active worktrees** | `worktree/f15-diary-followups` (`fix/f15-diary-followups`, PR #51). |

### Open questions / unresolved decisions

<!--
Things that are genuinely undecided, one bullet each, with enough context that
future-you can decide without re-deriving the problem. Strike a line through or
mark **RESOLVED <date>:** in place when it is settled — deleting it loses the
record that it was ever open.
-->

- **The kit's own gate policy has no seam of its own.** The `placeholder-unstamped`
  rule lives in `scripts/check.sh`, which is shared layer, and it exempts only
  `*.template` sources. Kit-authoring scripts that must name a mark therefore
  spell it from variables. That works and leaks nothing to consumers, but if a
  future kit file needs a *different* kit-only exemption, the shared gate will
  need a real policy seam and a minor bump with it.
- **Two shared-layer comments now read as slightly stale.**
  `scripts/docs-conformance/validators/claude-md-refs.mjs` still describes "the
  kit's own unbootstrapped tree" in two comments. They are correct as general
  statements and wrong only as an example. Fixing them is a shared-layer edit,
  so it waits for the next release that has to bump `VERSION` anyway.

### Memory pointers for future-me

<!--
The half-dozen facts you keep re-learning. Not documentation — pointers at it.
-->

- **The diary is the orientation document.** Read this `Current state` block at
  session start; everything below it is history.
- **`VERSION` decides what an edit costs.** A file listed there is copied
  verbatim into consumer projects: changing it means a minor bump, an
  `UPDATING.md` entry, and re-captured transcripts in `tests/docs-demo.sh`.
- **Two engines, one policy.** The docs gate's path roots are written twice —
  `claudeMdRefs.pathRoots` in `scripts/docs-conformance/config.mjs` and
  `path_roots` in `scripts/check.sh`. Adding a root to one alone splits the gate
  in half.
- **Decisions live in `docs/adr/`**, not here. A diary entry may *announce* a
  decision, but the ADR is the record.
- **Terms live in `docs/domain-glossary.md`.** One name per concept, everywhere.

### Update protocol

<!--
Shared invariant §8: a rule nothing checks decays into a lie. This protocol is
the cheapest honest form of "when does the diary get written?" — keep it short
enough that it is actually followed, and make the triggers observable events
rather than feelings.
-->

- **Phase milestone reached** → append a new dated entry below.
- **ADR added, decision reversed, or vendor changed** → append a new dated
  entry; do **not** edit old entries.
- **Shared layer moved (`VERSION` bumped)** → append an entry naming what joined
  or changed, and confirm `UPDATING.md` carries the recipe.
- **Worktree created for a non-trivial feature** → note it in the next entry;
  remove it from the active list when it merges.
- **Anything above happened** → also refresh the `Current state` block in place.

## Entries

<!--
Forward-chronological, newest at the BOTTOM (so reading top-to-bottom reads the
project's history in order). One `###` heading per entry:

    ### YYYY-MM-DD — <headline: what changed, not what you did>

Write what was decided and why, not a commit log — `git log` already exists.
Never edit a past entry; correct it with a new one that references it.

### 2026-08-27 — The kit started following its own framework

Until now the kit repo was deliberately unbootstrapped: no root `AGENTS.md`, no
shims, no `docs/`, and `sh scripts/check.sh` failed at its own root with
`root-manual-missing`. The gate the kit sells was only ever run against a
throwaway project built by `tests/kit-demo.sh`.

That is now closed. The repo has a hand-written `AGENTS.md` for the
kit-authoring context (not a stamped copy of the template it ships), the two
shims, this diary, an ADR index and glossary, and a green docs gate at the root
— enforced by a new `self-host` job in `.github/workflows/kit-ci.yml`.

The interesting part was making that compatible with being a *template*.
Consumers create their repo from this tree, so every kit-own file above is
sitting in the tree `bootstrap.sh` runs against, and bootstrap refuses to run
when `AGENTS.md` already exists. It now strips its own files first, guarded on
two conditions so neither a consumer's second run nor a hand-written manual is
harmed. `tests/self-host.test.sh` asserts the result by byte-identity: bootstrap
runs twice, once against the real tree and once against the same tree with the
kit-own files removed by hand, and the two projects must be identical.

The decision, its alternatives, and the honest limitations are in
`docs/adr/0001-the-kit-self-hosts-its-own-constitution.md`.

### 2026-08-27 — The kit-own strip stopped being able to delete a consumer's work

Follow-up to the entry above, from the independent review on PR #48. The strip
was guarded on *whether* to run, and on nothing about *what* it removed. Two
demonstrated losses: `rm -rf docs/adr` took an ADR a consumer had written before
their first bootstrap (an uncommitted one unrecoverably), and a consumer who
personalized the kit's `AGENTS.md` in place — leaving the sentinel comment where
its own text tells them to — had those edits deleted with exit 0.

Both are closed by making the block name exactly what it deletes and check that
it still owns it. `KIT_OWN` is now a list of **files**, so `docs/adr/` is never
removed as a directory and a consumer's decision record is out of the strip's
reach entirely; and a third condition refuses the whole run, before deleting
anything, when git reports a local modification to any file on the list. What
that condition cannot see — an edit already committed, or a tree with no commits
at all — is recorded as a trade-off in ADR-0001 rather than papered over: the
alternative was a shipped hash of every kit-own file, and a stale hash would
refuse *every* consumer's first run.

The second finding was the sharper one: the sentinel guard could be deleted from
`bootstrap.sh` outright and all fourteen suites stayed green. Hard rule 9 says a
rule with no failing check is a claim, and this was one. `tests/self-host.test.sh`
gained section E — a fixture per guard, each one a consumer who wrote something
in the window between "Use this template" and their first bootstrap. Removing
any one of the three conditions turns it red.

### 2026-08-27 — The kit maps its own capability tiers

The tier -> model resolver (`scripts/agents.lib.sh`) has always shipped with an
empty mapping by principle: the kit names no model to a consumer. That left the
kit's own sessions unmapped too — every subagent this repo spawns silently ran
on whatever model the session itself happened to be, regardless of the tier its
ticket was stamped with, which is the exact cost blindness the tier mechanism
exists to remove, happening inside the tool that preaches it.

`scripts/agents.kit.config.sh` closes that: a second, kit-only mapping, never
shipped (`bootstrap.sh`'s `KIT_ONLY` deletion list, same as `tests/`), reached
through the resolver's existing `$AGENTS_CONFIG` seam. The picks: planner and
reviewer on the strongest model available (`fable`), implementer on the best
coding workhorse (`opus`), mechanical on the cheapest capable model (`haiku`) —
and the reviewer is never the same model as the implementer, on principle: a
review from the implementer's own model is an editorial pass wearing a second
hat, not an adversarial read. `docs/adr/0001-…` and this repo's own PR reviews
(starting with PR #50) now run on that policy.

Independent review on PR #50 (a different model than the implementer, per the
policy above) found the mechanism sound but the reach incomplete: every
`SKILL.md` that spawns a subagent instructs the plain `sh scripts/agents.lib.sh
<tier>`, which resolves through the empty shipped config in this repo too — the
kit-only mapping only engages if the session remembers to prefix
`AGENTS_CONFIG=scripts/agents.kit.config.sh`, which a SKILL.md followed
literally does not do. Skills ship unstamped, so none of them may be edited to
name a kit-only file. The fix is `scripts/agents.kit.sh`, a kit-only wrapper
(same deletion list) that sets the seam and delegates — one name to substitute
for `scripts/agents.lib.sh`, promoted to `AGENTS.md` hard rule 10 so the
substitution is unmissable at the point of spawning, rather than an environment
prefix a session has to recall and type correctly every time.

## 2026-08-27 — merge train lands the self-hosting wave

`/merge-train 48 50 49`, operator-started. Order: #48 (self-hosting) → #50
(kit-only tier mapping, stacked) → #49 (domain routing, shared layer 0.7.0).
Two cars went stale mid-train because `main` had also taken #46/#47: #50's
conflict was one additive hunk in `tests/agents-tiers.test.sh`, resolved on the
head branch; #49 needed a full sync pass — four conflicted files, a VERSION
renumber (0.6.0 → 0.7.0, since main's config-discovery wave had claimed 0.6.0),
one mechanical transcript re-convergence, and the activation of
`AGENT_TIER_IMPLEMENTER_CONTENT='fable'` now that the domain seam and the kit
mapping coexist. Every merge went through the forge API with post-merge
workflows observed green; all seven worktrees (f9 × 2, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14)
were pruned as merged and `main` fast-forwarded to `fe0e171`.

The Current state table above gained its **Active worktrees** row in this same
change — the row the `/worktree-cleanup` skill expects to refresh did not exist
before, so its absence is recorded here rather than silently backfilled.

Follow-up candidates, both pre-existing and both surfaced by the #49 sync
session: `tests/docs-demo.sh` is named in `README.md` as a suite but no CI job
runs it, so the transcript byte-comparison gating `UPDATING.md` is local-only;
and `README.md`'s architecture section still says `shared-layer: 0.4.0`.

## 2026-08-27 — the two merge-train follow-ups became checks

Both follow-up candidates from the entry above are closed on
`fix/f15-diary-followups` (PR #51), each as a check rather than a fix alone
(hard rule 9): `tests/docs-demo.sh` gained its Kit CI job, and
`tests/self-host.test.sh` gained a section F that fails when any suite in
`tests/` has no workflow `run:` line — or when a workflow carries a job with
duplicate keys, which the forge answers by loading nothing. That second
tripwire is not hypothetical: the first draft of this very change pasted the
new job over the `skills:` key, Kit CI went dark on the branch, and the
independent review caught it while the naive substring form of F stayed green.
README's worked example now quotes the current `shared-layer:` marker, held to
`VERSION` by the same section; historical release references stay as history.
