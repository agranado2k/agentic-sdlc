# tests/fixture-builders.test.sh — the harness's fixture builders as a SEAM.
#
# Every demo suite builds throwaway kits and consumers; tests/lib.sh now builds
# them one way. This suite pins what each builder promises — a .git-free kit
# copy with nested worktrees stripped, a repo with a fixture identity and every
# signing switch off, a two-tag history whose tags resolve to the two trees,
# and a consumer bootstrapped from a tree with one commit — and proves each can
# go red. The demo suites are the builders' oracle in the large: section D of
# tests/docs-demo.sh compares transcripts byte for byte.
#
# Usage: sh tests/fixture-builders.test.sh
