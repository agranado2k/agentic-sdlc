Interview me relentlessly about every aspect of this plan until we reach a shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one. For each question, provide your recommended answer.

Ask the questions one at a time.

If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead.

As each branch resolves, record it — after the decision, never in place of it: `sh scripts/trace.sh emit kind=grill.decision [subject=<prd:#N, ticket:#N or branch:x, when the plan has one>] outcome=accepted|overridden data.recommended='<your recommended answer>' data.answer='<the answer taken>' reason='<why they chose it, one line>' || :`. `accepted` is your recommendation taken, `overridden` is theirs instead. The trace is written here and never read (ADR-0008); unconfigured, the call is a silent no-op.
